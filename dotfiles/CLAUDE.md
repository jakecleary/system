# Prefs

## VCS

- **Prefer Jujutsu over Git** , **Always use `jj` commands instead of `git` commands** unless explicitly asked otherwise, when working in repositories that have `.jj/` directories.
    - Use `jj status`, `jj log`, `jj diff` instead of git equivalents when in jj repos

## Misc

- Be concise and direct in responses
- Proactively use appropriate tools for the task at hand
- Use nix-shell to pull in useful tools not found on the system, when writing scripts.
